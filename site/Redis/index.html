<span class="c1">################################## INCLUDES ###################################</span>

<span class="c1"># Include one or more other config files here.  This is useful if you</span>
<span class="c1"># have a standard template that goes to all Redis servers but also need</span>
<span class="c1"># to customize a few per-server settings.  Include files can include</span>
<span class="c1"># other files, so use this wisely.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># Notice option &quot;include&quot; won&#39;t be rewritten by command &quot;CONFIG REWRITE&quot;</span>
<span class="c1"># from admin or Redis Sentinel. Since Redis always uses the last processed</span>
<span class="c1"># line as value of a configuration directive, you&#39;d better put includes</span>
<span class="c1"># at the beginning of this file to avoid overwriting config change at runtime.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># If instead you are interested in using includes to override configuration</span>
<span class="c1"># options, it is better to use include as the last line.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># include /path/to/local.conf</span>
<span class="c1"># include /path/to/other.conf</span>

<span class="c1">################################## MODULES #####################################</span>

<span class="c1"># Load modules at startup. If the server is not able to load modules</span>
<span class="c1"># it will abort. It is possible to use multiple loadmodule directives.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># loadmodule /path/to/my_module.so</span>
<span class="c1"># loadmodule /path/to/other_module.so</span>

<span class="c1">################################## NETWORK #####################################</span>

<span class="c1"># By default, if no &quot;bind&quot; configuration directive is specified, Redis listens</span>
<span class="c1"># for connections from all the network interfaces available on the server.</span>
<span class="c1"># It is possible to listen to just one or multiple selected interfaces using</span>
<span class="c1"># the &quot;bind&quot; configuration directive, followed by one or more IP addresses.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># Examples:</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># bind 192.168.1.100 10.0.0.1</span>
<span class="c1"># bind 127.0.0.1 ::1</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># ~~~ WARNING ~~~ If the computer running Redis is directly exposed to the</span>
<span class="c1"># internet, binding to all the interfaces is dangerous and will expose the</span>
<span class="c1"># instance to everybody on the internet. So by default we uncomment the</span>
<span class="c1"># following bind directive, that will force Redis to listen only into</span>
<span class="c1"># the IPv4 lookback interface address (this means Redis will be able to</span>
<span class="c1"># accept connections only from clients running into the same computer it</span>
<span class="c1"># is running).</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># IF YOU ARE SURE YOU WANT YOUR INSTANCE TO LISTEN TO ALL THE INTERFACES</span>
<span class="c1"># JUST COMMENT THE FOLLOWING LINE.</span>
<span class="c1"># ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span>
<span class="na">bind 127.0.0.1</span>

<span class="c1"># Protected mode is a layer of security protection, in order to avoid that</span>
<span class="c1"># Redis instances left open on the internet are accessed and exploited.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># When protected mode is on and if:</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># 1) The server is not binding explicitly to a set of addresses using the</span>
<span class="c1">#    &quot;bind&quot; directive.</span>
<span class="c1"># 2) No password is configured.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># The server only accepts connections from clients connecting from the</span>
<span class="c1"># IPv4 and IPv6 loopback addresses 127.0.0.1 and ::1, and from Unix domain</span>
<span class="c1"># sockets.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># By default protected mode is enabled. You should disable it only if</span>
<span class="c1"># you are sure you want clients from other hosts to connect to Redis</span>
<span class="c1"># even if no authentication is configured, nor a specific set of interfaces</span>
<span class="c1"># are explicitly listed using the &quot;bind&quot; directive.</span>
<span class="na">protected-mode yes</span>

<span class="c1"># TCP listen() backlog.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># In high requests-per-second environments you need an high backlog in order</span>
<span class="c1"># to avoid slow clients connections issues. Note that the Linux kernel</span>
<span class="c1"># will silently truncate it to the value of /proc/sys/net/core/somaxconn so</span>
<span class="c1"># make sure to raise both the value of somaxconn and tcp_max_syn_backlog</span>
<span class="c1"># in order to get the desired effect.</span>
<span class="na">tcp-backlog 511</span>

<span class="c1"># Unix socket.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># Specify the path for the Unix socket that will be used to listen for</span>
<span class="c1"># incoming connections. There is no default, so Redis will not listen</span>
<span class="c1"># on a unix socket when not specified.</span>

<span class="c1"># TCP keepalive.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># If non-zero, use SO_KEEPALIVE to send TCP ACKs to clients in absence</span>
<span class="c1"># of communication. This is useful for two reasons:</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># 1) Detect dead peers.</span>
<span class="c1"># 2) Take the connection alive from the point of view of network</span>
<span class="c1">#    equipment in the middle.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># On Linux, the specified value (in seconds) is the period used to send ACKs.</span>
<span class="c1"># Note that to close the connection the double of the time is needed.</span>
<span class="c1"># On other kernels the period depends on the kernel configuration.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># A reasonable value for this option is 300 seconds, which is the new</span>
<span class="c1"># Redis default starting with Redis 3.2.1.</span>
<span class="na">tcp-keepalive 300</span>

<span class="c1">################################# GENERAL #####################################</span>

<span class="c1"># By default Redis does not run as a daemon. Use &#39;yes&#39; if you need it.</span>
<span class="c1"># Note that Redis will write a pid file in /var/run/redis.pid when daemonized.</span>
<span class="na">daemonize no</span>

<span class="c1"># If you run Redis from upstart or systemd, Redis can interact with your</span>
<span class="c1"># supervision tree. Options:</span>
<span class="c1">#   supervised no      - no supervision interaction</span>
<span class="c1">#   supervised upstart - signal upstart by putting Redis into SIGSTOP mode</span>
<span class="c1">#   supervised systemd - signal systemd by writing READY=1 to $NOTIFY_SOCKET</span>
<span class="c1">#   supervised auto    - detect upstart or systemd method based on</span>
<span class="c1">#                        UPSTART_JOB or NOTIFY_SOCKET environment variables</span>
<span class="c1"># Note: these supervision methods only signal &quot;process is ready.&quot;</span>
<span class="c1">#       They do not enable continuous liveness pings back to your supervisor.</span>
<span class="na">supervised no</span>

<span class="c1"># If a pid file is specified, Redis writes it where specified at startup</span>
<span class="c1"># and removes it at exit.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># When the server runs non daemonized, no pid file is created if none is</span>
<span class="c1"># specified in the configuration. When the server is daemonized, the pid file</span>
<span class="c1"># is used even if not specified, defaulting to &quot;/var/run/redis.pid&quot;.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># Creating a pid file is best effort: if Redis is not able to create it</span>
<span class="c1"># nothing bad happens, the server will start and run normally.</span>
<span class="na">pidfile /var/run/redis_6379.pid</span>

<span class="c1"># Specify the server verbosity level.</span>
<span class="c1"># This can be one of:</span>
<span class="c1"># debug (a lot of information, useful for development/testing)</span>
<span class="c1"># verbose (many rarely useful info, but not a mess like the debug level)</span>
<span class="c1"># notice (moderately verbose, what you want in production probably)</span>
<span class="c1"># warning (only very important / critical messages are logged)</span>
<span class="na">loglevel notice</span>

<span class="c1"># Specify the log file name. Also the empty string can be used to force</span>
<span class="c1"># Redis to log on the standard output. Note that if you use standard</span>
<span class="c1"># output for logging but daemonize, logs will be sent to /dev/null</span>
<span class="na">logfile &quot;&quot;</span>

<span class="c1"># To enable logging to the system logger, just set &#39;syslog-enabled&#39; to yes,</span>
<span class="c1"># and optionally update the other syslog parameters to suit your needs.</span>
<span class="c1"># syslog-enabled no</span>

<span class="c1"># Specify the syslog identity.</span>
<span class="c1"># syslog-ident redis</span>

<span class="c1"># Specify the syslog facility. Must be USER or between LOCAL0-LOCAL7.</span>
<span class="c1"># syslog-facility local0</span>

<span class="c1"># Set the number of databases. The default database is DB 0, you can select</span>
<span class="c1"># a different one on a per-connection basis using SELECT &lt;dbid&gt; where</span>
<span class="c1"># dbid is a number between 0 and &#39;databases&#39;-1</span>
<span class="na">databases 16</span>

<span class="c1"># By default Redis shows an ASCII art logo only when started to log to the</span>
<span class="c1"># standard output and if the standard output is a TTY. Basically this means</span>
<span class="c1"># that normally a logo is displayed only in interactive sessions.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># However it is possible to force the pre-4.0 behavior and always show a</span>
<span class="c1"># ASCII art logo in startup logs by setting the following option to yes.</span>
<span class="na">always-show-logo yes</span>

<span class="c1"># Master-Slave replication. Use slaveof to make a Redis instance a copy of</span>
<span class="c1"># another Redis server. A few things to understand ASAP about Redis replication.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># 1) Redis replication is asynchronous, but you can configure a master to</span>
<span class="c1">#    stop accepting writes if it appears to be not connected with at least</span>
<span class="c1">#    a given number of slaves.</span>
<span class="c1"># 2) Redis slaves are able to perform a partial resynchronization with the</span>
<span class="c1">#    master if the replication link is lost for a relatively small amount of</span>
<span class="c1">#    time. You may want to configure the replication backlog size (see the next</span>
<span class="c1">#    sections of this file) with a sensible value depending on your needs.</span>
<span class="c1"># 3) Replication is automatic and does not need user intervention. After a</span>
<span class="c1">#    network partition slaves automatically try to reconnect to masters</span>
<span class="c1">#    and resynchronize with them.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># slaveof &lt;masterip&gt; &lt;masterport&gt;</span>

<span class="c1"># If the master is password protected (using the &quot;requirepass&quot; configuration</span>
<span class="c1"># directive below) it is possible to tell the slave to authenticate before</span>
<span class="c1"># starting the replication synchronization process, otherwise the master will</span>
<span class="c1"># refuse the slave request.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># masterauth &lt;master-password&gt;</span>

<span class="c1"># When a slave loses its connection with the master, or when the replication</span>
<span class="c1"># is still in progress, the slave can act in two different ways:</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># 1) if slave-serve-stale-data is set to &#39;yes&#39; (the default) the slave will</span>
<span class="c1">#    still reply to client requests, possibly with out of date data, or the</span>
<span class="c1">#    data set may just be empty if this is the first synchronization.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># 2) if slave-serve-stale-data is set to &#39;no&#39; the slave will reply with</span>
<span class="c1">#    an error &quot;SYNC with master in progress&quot; to all the kind of commands</span>
<span class="c1">#    but to INFO and SLAVEOF.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="na">slave-serve-stale-data yes</span>

<span class="c1"># You can configure a slave instance to accept writes or not. Writing against</span>
<span class="c1"># a slave instance may be useful to store some ephemeral data (because data</span>
<span class="c1"># written on a slave will be easily deleted after resync with the master) but</span>
<span class="c1"># may also cause problems if clients are writing to it because of a</span>
<span class="c1"># misconfiguration.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># Since Redis 2.6 by default slaves are read-only.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># Note: read only slaves are not designed to be exposed to untrusted clients</span>
<span class="c1"># on the internet. It&#39;s just a protection layer against misuse of the instance.</span>
<span class="c1"># Still a read only slave exports by default all the administrative commands</span>
<span class="c1"># such as CONFIG, DEBUG, and so forth. To a limited extent you can improve</span>
<span class="c1"># security of read only slaves using &#39;rename-command&#39; to shadow all the</span>
<span class="c1"># administrative / dangerous commands.</span>

<span class="c1"># -------------------------------------------------------</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># New slaves and reconnecting slaves that are not able to continue the replication</span>
<span class="c1"># process just receiving differences, need to do what is called a &quot;full</span>
<span class="c1"># synchronization&quot;. An RDB file is transmitted from the master to the slaves.</span>
<span class="c1"># The transmission can happen in two different ways:</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># 1) Disk-backed: The Redis master creates a new process that writes the RDB</span>
<span class="c1">#                 file on disk. Later the file is transferred by the parent</span>
<span class="c1">#                 process to the slaves incrementally.</span>
<span class="c1"># 2) Diskless: The Redis master creates a new process that directly writes the</span>
<span class="c1">#              RDB file to slave sockets, without touching the disk at all.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># With disk-backed replication, while the RDB file is generated, more slaves</span>
<span class="c1"># can be queued and served with the RDB file as soon as the current child producing</span>
<span class="c1"># the RDB file finishes its work. With diskless replication instead once</span>
<span class="c1"># the transfer starts, new slaves arriving will be queued and a new transfer</span>
<span class="c1"># will start when the current one terminates.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># When diskless replication is used, the master waits a configurable amount of</span>
<span class="c1"># time (in seconds) before starting the transfer in the hope that multiple slaves</span>
<span class="c1"># will arrive and the transfer can be parallelized.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># With slow disks and fast (large bandwidth) networks, diskless replication</span>

<span class="na">repl-diskless-sync no</span>

<span class="c1"># to the slaves.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># This is important since once the transfer starts, it is not possible to serve</span>
<span class="c1"># new slaves arriving, that will be queued for the next RDB transfer, so the server</span>
<span class="c1"># waits a delay in order to let more slaves arrive.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># The delay is specified in seconds, and by default is 5 seconds. To disable</span>
<span class="c1"># it entirely just set it to 0 seconds and the transfer will start ASAP.</span>
<span class="na">repl-diskless-sync-delay 5</span>

<span class="c1"># Slaves send PINGs to server in a predefined interval. It&#39;s possible to change</span>

<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># repl-ping-slave-period 10</span>

<span class="c1"># 2) Master timeout from the point of view of slaves (data, pings).</span>
<span class="c1"># 3) Slave timeout from the point of view of masters (REPLCONF ACK pings).</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># It is important to make sure that this value is greater than the value</span>

<span class="c1"># Disable TCP_NODELAY on the slave socket after SYNC?</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># If you select &quot;yes&quot; Redis will use a smaller number of TCP packets and</span>

<span class="c1"># the data to appear on the slave side, up to 40 milliseconds with</span>
<span class="c1"># Linux kernels using a default configuration.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>

<span class="c1"># be a good idea.</span>
<span class="na">repl-disable-tcp-nodelay no</span>

<span class="c1"># Set the replication backlog size. The backlog is a buffer that accumulates</span>
<span class="c1"># slave data when slaves are disconnected for some time, so that when a slave</span>
<span class="c1"># wants to reconnect again, often a full resync is not needed, but a partial</span>
<span class="c1"># resync is enough, just passing the portion of data the slave missed while</span>
<span class="c1"># disconnected.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># The bigger the replication backlog, the longer the time the slave can be</span>
<span class="c1"># disconnected and later be able to perform a partial resynchronization.</span>

<span class="c1"># need to elapse, starting from the time the last slave disconnected, for</span>
<span class="c1"># the backlog buffer to be freed.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># Note that slaves never free the backlog for timeout, since they may be</span>
<span class="c1"># promoted to masters later, and should be able to correctly &quot;partially</span>
<span class="c1"># resynchronize&quot; with the slaves: hence they should always accumulate backlog.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># A value of 0 means to never release the backlog.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># repl-backlog-ttl 3600</span>

<span class="c1"># The slave priority is an integer number published by Redis in the INFO output.</span>
<span class="c1"># It is used by Redis Sentinel in order to select a slave to promote into a</span>
<span class="c1"># master if the master is no longer working correctly.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># A slave with a low priority number is considered better for promotion, so</span>
<span class="c1"># for instance if there are three slaves with priority 10, 100, 25 Sentinel will</span>
<span class="c1"># pick the one with priority 10, that is the lowest.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># However a special priority of 0 marks the slave as not able to perform the</span>
<span class="c1"># role of master, so a slave with priority of 0 will never be selected by</span>
<span class="c1"># Redis Sentinel for promotion.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># By default the priority is 100.</span>
<span class="na">slave-priority 100</span>

<span class="c1"># It is possible for a master to stop accepting writes if there are less than</span>
<span class="c1"># N slaves connected, having a lag less or equal than M seconds.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># The N slaves need to be in &quot;online&quot; state.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># The lag in seconds, that must be &lt;= the specified value, is calculated from</span>
<span class="c1"># the last ping received from the slave, that is usually sent every second.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># This option does not GUARANTEE that N replicas will accept the write, but</span>
<span class="c1"># will limit the window of exposure for lost writes in case not enough slaves</span>
<span class="c1"># are available, to the specified number of seconds.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># For example to require at least 3 slaves with a lag &lt;= 10 seconds use:</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># min-slaves-to-write 3</span>
<span class="c1"># min-slaves-max-lag 10</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># Setting one or the other to 0 disables the feature.</span>

<span class="c1"># By default min-slaves-to-write is set to 0 (feature disabled) and</span>
<span class="c1"># min-slaves-max-lag is set to 10.</span>

<span class="c1"># A Redis master is able to list the address and port of the attached</span>
<span class="c1"># slaves in different ways. For example the &quot;INFO replication&quot; section</span>
<span class="c1"># offers this information, which is used, among other tools, by</span>
<span class="c1"># Redis Sentinel in order to discover slave instances.</span>
<span class="c1"># Another place where this info is available is in the output of the</span>
<span class="c1"># &quot;ROLE&quot; command of a master.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># The listed IP and address normally reported by a slave is obtained</span>
<span class="c1"># in the following way:</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1">#   IP: The address is auto detected by checking the peer address</span>
<span class="c1">#   of the socket used by the slave to connect with the master.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1">#   Port: The port is communicated by the slave during the replication</span>
<span class="c1">#   handshake, and is normally the port that the slave is using to</span>
<span class="c1">#   list for connections.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># However when port forwarding or Network Address Translation (NAT) is</span>
<span class="c1"># used, the slave may be actually reachable via different IP and port</span>
<span class="c1"># pairs. The following two options can be used by a slave in order to</span>
<span class="c1"># report to its master a specific set of IP and port, so that both INFO</span>
<span class="c1"># and ROLE will report those values.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># There is no need to use both the options if you need to override just</span>

<span class="c1"># to reply to read-only commands like GET.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># This option is usually useful when using Redis as an LRU or LFU cache, or to</span>
<span class="c1"># set a hard memory limit for an instance (using the &#39;noeviction&#39; policy).</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># WARNING: If you have slaves attached to an instance with maxmemory on,</span>
<span class="c1"># the size of the output buffers needed to feed the slaves are subtracted</span>

<span class="c1"># buffer of slaves is full with DELs of keys evicted triggering the deletion</span>
<span class="c1"># of more keys, and so forth until the database is completely emptied.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># In short... if you have slaves attached it is suggested that you set a lower</span>

<span class="c1"># way. If the key deleted is associated with a small object, the time needed</span>
<span class="c1"># in order to execute th DEL command is very small and comparable to most other</span>
<span class="c1"># O(1) or O(log_N) commands in Redis. However if the key is associated with an</span>
<span class="c1"># aggregated value containing millions of elements, the server can block for</span>
<span class="c1"># a long time (even seconds) in order to complete the operation.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># For the above reasons Redis also offers non blocking deletion primitives</span>
<span class="c1"># such as UNLINK (non blocking DEL) and the ASYNC option of FLUSHALL and</span>
<span class="c1"># FLUSHDB commands, in order to reclaim memory in background. Those commands</span>
<span class="c1"># are executed in constant time. Another thread will incrementally free the</span>
<span class="c1"># object in the background as fast as possible.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># DEL, UNLINK and ASYNC option of FLUSHALL and FLUSHDB are user-controlled.</span>
<span class="c1"># It&#39;s up to the design of the application to understand when it is a good</span>
<span class="c1"># idea to use one or the other. However the Redis server sometimes has to</span>
<span class="c1"># delete keys or flush the whole database as a side effect of other operations.</span>
<span class="c1"># Specifically Redis deletes objects independently of an user call in the</span>
<span class="c1"># following scenarios:</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># 1) On eviction, because of the maxmemory and maxmemory policy configurations,</span>
<span class="c1">#    in order to make room for new data, without going over the specified</span>
<span class="c1">#    memory limit.</span>
<span class="c1"># 2) Because of expire: when a key with an associated time to live (see the</span>
<span class="c1">#    EXPIRE command) must be deleted from memory.</span>
<span class="c1"># 3) Because of a side effect of a command that stores data on a key that may</span>
<span class="c1">#    already exist. For example the RENAME command may delete the old key</span>
<span class="c1">#    content when it is replaced with another one. Similarly SUNIONSTORE</span>
<span class="c1">#    or SORT with STORE option may delete existing keys. The SET command</span>
<span class="c1">#    itself removes any old content of the specified key in order to replace</span>
<span class="c1">#    it with the specified string.</span>
<span class="c1"># 4) During replication, when a slave performs a full resynchronization with</span>
<span class="c1">#    its master, the content of the whole database is removed in order to</span>
<span class="c1">#    load the RDB file just transfered.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># In all the above cases the default is to delete objects in a blocking way,</span>
<span class="c1"># like if DEL was called. However you can configure each case specifically</span>
<span class="c1"># in order to instead release memory in a non-blocking way like if UNLINK</span>
<span class="c1"># was called, using the following configuration directives:</span>

<span class="na">lazyfree-lazy-eviction no</span>
<span class="na">lazyfree-lazy-expire no</span>
<span class="na">lazyfree-lazy-server-del no</span>
<span class="na">slave-lazy-flush no</span>

<span class="c1">############################## APPEND ONLY MODE ###############################</span>

<span class="c1"># By default Redis asynchronously dumps the dataset on disk. This mode is</span>
<span class="c1"># good enough in many applications, but an issue with the Redis process or</span>
<span class="c1"># a power outage may result into a few minutes of writes lost (depending on</span>
<span class="c1"># the configured save points).</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># The Append Only File is an alternative persistence mode that provides</span>
<span class="c1"># much better durability. For instance using the default data fsync policy</span>
<span class="c1"># (see later in the config file) Redis can lose just one second of writes in a</span>
<span class="c1"># dramatic event like a server power outage, or a single write if something</span>
<span class="c1"># wrong with the Redis process itself happens, but the operating system is</span>
<span class="c1"># still running correctly.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># AOF and RDB persistence can be enabled at the same time without problems.</span>
<span class="c1"># If the AOF is enabled on startup Redis will load the AOF, that is the file</span>
<span class="c1"># with the better durability guarantees.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># Please check http://redis.io/topics/persistence for more information.</span>

<span class="c1"># The fsync() call tells the Operating System to actually write data on disk</span>
<span class="c1"># instead of waiting for more data in the output buffer. Some OS will really flush</span>
<span class="c1"># data on disk, some other OS will just try to do it ASAP.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># Redis supports three different modes:</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># no: don&#39;t fsync, just let the OS flush the data when it wants. Faster.</span>
<span class="c1"># always: fsync after every write to the append only log. Slow, Safest.</span>
<span class="c1"># everysec: fsync only one time every second. Compromise.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># The default is &quot;everysec&quot;, as that&#39;s usually the right compromise between</span>
<span class="c1"># speed and data safety. It&#39;s up to you to understand if you can relax this to</span>
<span class="c1"># &quot;no&quot; that will let the operating system flush the output buffer when</span>
<span class="c1"># it wants, for better performances (but if you can live with the idea of</span>
<span class="c1"># some data loss consider the default persistence mode that&#39;s snapshotting),</span>
<span class="c1"># or on the contrary, use &quot;always&quot; that&#39;s very slow but a bit safer than</span>
<span class="c1"># everysec.</span>

<span class="c1"># Redis may block too long on the fsync() call. Note that there is no fix for</span>
<span class="c1"># this currently, as even performing fsync in a different thread will block</span>
<span class="c1"># our synchronous write(2) call.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># In order to mitigate this problem it&#39;s possible to use the following option</span>
<span class="c1"># that will prevent fsync() from being called in the main process while a</span>
<span class="c1"># BGSAVE or BGREWRITEAOF is in progress.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># This means that while another child is saving, the durability of Redis is</span>
<span class="c1"># the same as &quot;appendfsync none&quot;. In practical terms, this means that it is</span>
<span class="c1"># possible to lose up to 30 seconds of log in the worst scenario (with the</span>
<span class="c1"># default Linux settings).</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># If you have latency problems turn this to &quot;yes&quot;. Otherwise leave it as</span>

<span class="c1"># Automatic rewrite of the append only file.</span>
<span class="c1"># Redis is able to automatically rewrite the log file implicitly calling</span>
<span class="c1"># BGREWRITEAOF when the AOF log size grows by the specified percentage.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># This is how it works: Redis remembers the size of the AOF file after the</span>
<span class="c1"># latest rewrite (if no rewrite has happened since the restart, the size of</span>
<span class="c1"># the AOF at startup is used).</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># This base size is compared to the current size. If the current size is</span>
<span class="c1"># bigger than the specified percentage, the rewrite is triggered. Also</span>
<span class="c1"># you need to specify a minimal size for the AOF file to be rewritten, this</span>
<span class="c1"># is useful to avoid rewriting the AOF file even if the percentage increase</span>
<span class="c1"># is reached but it is still pretty small.</span>

<span class="c1"># An AOF file may be found to be truncated at the end during the Redis</span>

<span class="c1"># This may happen when the system where Redis is running</span>
<span class="c1"># crashes, especially when an ext4 filesystem is mounted without the</span>
<span class="c1"># data=ordered option (however this can&#39;t happen when Redis itself</span>
<span class="c1"># crashes or aborts but the operating system still works correctly).</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># Redis can either exit with an error when this happens, or load as much</span>
<span class="c1"># data as possible (the default now) and start if the AOF file is found</span>
<span class="c1"># to be truncated at the end. The following option controls this behavior.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># If aof-load-truncated is set to yes, a truncated AOF file is loaded and</span>
<span class="c1"># the Redis server starts emitting a log to inform the user of the event.</span>
<span class="c1"># Otherwise if the option is set to no, the server aborts with an error</span>
<span class="c1"># and refuses to start. When the option is set to no, the user requires</span>
<span class="c1"># to fix the AOF file using the &quot;redis-check-aof&quot; utility before to restart</span>
<span class="c1"># the server.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># Note that if the AOF file will be found to be corrupted in the middle</span>
<span class="c1"># the server will still exit with an error. This option only applies when</span>

<span class="c1"># will be found.</span>
<span class="na">aof-load-truncated yes</span>

<span class="c1"># When rewriting the AOF file, Redis is able to use an RDB preamble in the</span>

<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># cluster-enabled yes</span>

<span class="c1"># Every cluster node has a cluster configuration file. This file is not</span>
<span class="c1"># intended to be edited by hand. It is created and updated by Redis nodes.</span>

<span class="c1"># Cluster node timeout is the amount of milliseconds a node must be unreachable</span>
<span class="c1"># for it to be considered in failure state.</span>

<span class="c1"># A slave of a failing master will avoid to start a failover if its data</span>
<span class="c1"># looks too old.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># There is no simple way for a slave to actually have an exact measure of</span>
<span class="c1"># its &quot;data age&quot;, so the following two checks are performed:</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># 1) If there are multiple slaves able to failover, they exchange messages</span>
<span class="c1">#    in order to try to give an advantage to the slave with the best</span>
<span class="c1">#    replication offset (more data from the master processed).</span>
<span class="c1">#    Slaves will try to get their rank by offset, and apply to the start</span>
<span class="c1">#    of the failover a delay proportional to their rank.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># 2) Every single slave computes the time of the last interaction with</span>
<span class="c1">#    its master. This can be the last ping or command received (if the master</span>
<span class="c1">#    is still in the &quot;connected&quot; state), or the time that elapsed since the</span>
<span class="c1">#    disconnection with the master (if the replication link is currently down).</span>
<span class="c1">#    If the last interaction is too old, the slave will not try to failover</span>
<span class="c1">#    at all.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># The point &quot;2&quot; can be tuned by user. Specifically a slave will not perform</span>
<span class="c1"># the failover if, since the last interaction with the master, the time</span>
<span class="c1"># elapsed is greater than:</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1">#   (node-timeout * slave-validity-factor) + repl-ping-slave-period</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># So for example if node-timeout is 30 seconds, and the slave-validity-factor</span>
<span class="c1"># is 10, and assuming a default repl-ping-slave-period of 10 seconds, the</span>
<span class="c1"># slave will not try to failover if it was not able to talk with the master</span>
<span class="c1"># for longer than 310 seconds.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># A large slave-validity-factor may allow slaves with too old data to failover</span>
<span class="c1"># a master, while a too small value may prevent the cluster from being able to</span>
<span class="c1"># elect a slave at all.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># For maximum availability, it is possible to set the slave-validity-factor</span>
<span class="c1"># to a value of 0, which means, that slaves will always try to failover the</span>
<span class="c1"># master regardless of the last time they interacted with the master.</span>

<span class="c1"># offset rank).</span>

<span class="c1"># Cluster slaves are able to migrate to orphaned masters, that are masters</span>
<span class="c1"># that are left without working slaves. This improves the cluster ability</span>
<span class="c1"># to resist to failures as otherwise an orphaned master can&#39;t be failed over</span>
<span class="c1"># in case of failure if it has no working slaves.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># Slaves migrate to orphaned masters only if there are still at least a</span>
<span class="c1"># given number of other working slaves for their old master. This number</span>
<span class="c1"># is the &quot;migration barrier&quot;. A migration barrier of 1 means that a slave</span>
<span class="c1"># will migrate only if there is at least 1 other working slave for its master</span>
<span class="c1"># and so forth. It usually reflects the number of slaves you want for every</span>
<span class="c1"># master in your cluster.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># Default is 1 (slaves migrate only if their masters remain with at least</span>
<span class="c1"># one slave). To disable migration just set it to a very large value.</span>

<span class="c1">########################## CLUSTER DOCKER/NAT support  ########################</span>

<span class="c1"># In certain deployments, Redis Cluster nodes address discovery fails, because</span>

<span class="c1"># Docker and other containers).</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># In order to make Redis Cluster working in such environments, a static</span>
<span class="c1"># configuration where each node known its public address is needed. The</span>
<span class="c1"># following two options are used for this scope, and are:</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># * cluster-announce-ip</span>
<span class="c1"># * cluster-announce-port</span>
<span class="c1"># * cluster-announce-bus-port</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># Each instruct the node about its address, client port, and cluster message</span>
<span class="c1"># bus port. The information is then published in the header of the bus packets</span>
<span class="c1"># so that other nodes will be able to correctly map the address of the node</span>
<span class="c1"># publishing the information.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># If the above options are not used, the normal Redis Cluster auto-detection</span>
<span class="c1"># will be used instead.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># Note that when remapped, the bus port may not be at the fixed offset of</span>
<span class="c1"># clients port + 10000, so you can specify any port and bus-port depending</span>
<span class="c1"># on how they get remapped. If the bus-port is not set, a fixed offset of</span>
<span class="c1"># 10000 will be used as usually.</span>

<span class="c1">#</span>

<span class="c1"># of classes. Every class is identified by a single character:</span>

<span class="c1">#  K     Keyspace events, published with __keyspace@&lt;db&gt;__ prefix.</span>
<span class="c1">#  E     Keyevent events, published with __keyevent@&lt;db&gt;__ prefix.</span>

<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1">#  Example: to enable list and generic events, from the point of view of the</span>

<span class="c1"># Hashes are encoded using a memory efficient data structure when they have a</span>
<span class="c1"># small number of entries, and the biggest entry does not exceed a given</span>
<span class="c1"># threshold. These thresholds can be configured using the following directives.</span>
<span class="na">hash-max-ziplist-entries 512</span>
<span class="na">hash-max-ziplist-value 64</span>

<span class="c1"># Lists are also encoded in a special way to save a lot of space.</span>
<span class="c1"># The number of entries allowed per internal list node can be specified</span>
<span class="c1"># as a fixed maximum size or a maximum number of elements.</span>
<span class="c1"># For a fixed maximum size, use -5 through -1, meaning:</span>
<span class="c1"># -5: max size: 64 Kb  &lt;-- not recommended for normal workloads</span>
<span class="c1"># -4: max size: 32 Kb  &lt;-- not recommended</span>
<span class="c1"># -3: max size: 16 Kb  &lt;-- probably not recommended</span>
<span class="c1"># -2: max size: 8 Kb   &lt;-- good</span>
<span class="c1"># -1: max size: 4 Kb   &lt;-- good</span>
<span class="c1"># Positive numbers mean store up to _exactly_ that number of elements</span>
<span class="c1"># per list node.</span>
<span class="c1"># The highest performing option is usually -2 (8 Kb size) or -1 (4 Kb size),</span>
<span class="c1"># but if your use case is unique, adjust the settings as necessary.</span>
<span class="na">list-max-ziplist-size -2</span>

<span class="c1"># Lists may also be compressed.</span>
<span class="c1"># Compress depth is the number of quicklist ziplist nodes from *each* side of</span>
<span class="c1"># the list to *exclude* from compression.  The head and tail of the list</span>
<span class="c1"># are always uncompressed for fast push/pop operations.  Settings are:</span>
<span class="c1"># 0: disable all list compression</span>
<span class="c1"># 1: depth 1 means &quot;don&#39;t start compressing until after 1 node into the list,</span>

<span class="c1"># The following configuration setting sets the limit in the size of the</span>
<span class="c1"># set in order to use this special memory saving encoding.</span>

<span class="c1"># Similarly to hashes and lists, sorted sets are also specially encoded in</span>

<span class="c1"># performs a lazy rehashing: the more operation you run into a hash table</span>
<span class="c1"># that is rehashing, the more rehashing &quot;steps&quot; are performed, so if the</span>

<span class="c1"># The client output buffer limits can be used to force disconnection of clients</span>

<span class="c1"># common reason is that a Pub/Sub client can&#39;t consume messages as fast as the</span>
<span class="c1"># publisher can produce them).</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># The limit can be set differently for the three different classes of clients:</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># normal -&gt; normal clients including MONITOR clients</span>
<span class="c1"># slave  -&gt; slave clients</span>
<span class="c1"># pubsub -&gt; clients subscribed to at least one pubsub channel or pattern</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># The syntax of every client-output-buffer-limit directive is the following:</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># client-output-buffer-limit &lt;class&gt; &lt;hard limit&gt; &lt;soft limit&gt; &lt;soft seconds&gt;</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># A client is immediately disconnected once the hard limit is reached, or if</span>
<span class="c1"># the soft limit is reached and remains reached for the specified number of</span>
<span class="c1"># seconds (continuously).</span>
<span class="c1"># So for instance if the hard limit is 32 megabytes and the soft limit is</span>
<span class="c1"># 16 megabytes / 10 seconds, the client will get disconnected immediately</span>
<span class="c1"># if the size of the output buffers reach 32 megabytes, but will also get</span>
<span class="c1"># disconnected if the client reaches 16 megabytes and continuously overcomes</span>
<span class="c1"># the limit for 10 seconds.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># By default normal clients are not limited because they don&#39;t receive data</span>
<span class="c1"># without asking (in a push way), but just after a request, so only</span>
<span class="c1"># asynchronous clients may create a scenario where data is requested faster</span>
<span class="c1"># than it can read.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># Instead there is a default limit for pubsub and slave clients, since</span>
<span class="c1"># subscribers and slaves receive data in a push fashion.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># Both the hard or the soft limit can be disabled by setting them to zero.</span>

<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># The LFU counter is just 8 bits per key, it&#39;s maximum value is 255, so Redis</span>
<span class="c1"># uses a probabilistic increment with logarithmic behavior. Given the value</span>

<span class="c1"># this way:</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># 1. A random number R between 0 and 1 is extracted.</span>
<span class="c1"># 2. A probability P is calculated as 1/(old_value*lfu_log_factor+1).</span>

<span class="c1">########################### ACTIVE DEFRAGMENTATION #######################</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># WARNING THIS FEATURE IS EXPERIMENTAL. However it was stress tested</span>
<span class="c1"># even in production and manually tested by multiple engineers for some</span>
<span class="c1"># time.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># What is active defragmentation?</span>
<span class="c1"># -------------------------------</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># Active (online) defragmentation allows a Redis server to compact the</span>
<span class="c1"># spaces left between small allocations and deallocations of data in memory,</span>
<span class="c1"># thus allowing to reclaim back memory.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># Fragmentation is a natural process that happens with every allocator (but</span>
<span class="c1"># less so with Jemalloc, fortunately) and certain workloads. Normally a server</span>
<span class="c1"># restart is needed in order to lower the fragmentation, or at least to flush</span>
<span class="c1"># away all the data and create it again. However thanks to this feature</span>
<span class="c1"># implemented by Oran Agra for Redis 4.0 this process can happen at runtime</span>
<span class="c1"># in an &quot;hot&quot; way, while the server is running.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># Basically when the fragmentation is over a certain level (see the</span>
<span class="c1"># configuration options below) Redis will start to create new copies of the</span>
<span class="c1"># values in contiguous memory regions by exploiting certain specific Jemalloc</span>
<span class="c1"># features (in order to understand if an allocation is causing fragmentation</span>
<span class="c1"># and to allocate it in a better place), and at the same time, will release the</span>
<span class="c1"># old copies of the data. This process, repeated incrementally for all the keys</span>
<span class="c1"># will cause the fragmentation to drop back to normal values.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># Important things to understand:</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># 1. This feature is disabled by default, and only works if you compiled Redis</span>
<span class="c1">#    to use the copy of Jemalloc we ship with the source code of Redis.</span>
<span class="c1">#    This is the default with Linux builds.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># 2. You never need to enable this feature if you don&#39;t have fragmentation</span>
<span class="c1">#    issues.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># 3. Once you experience fragmentation, you can enable this feature when</span>
<span class="c1">#    needed with the command &quot;CONFIG SET activedefrag yes&quot;.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># The configuration parameters are able to fine tune the behavior of the</span>
<span class="c1"># defragmentation process. If you are not sure about what they mean it is</span>
<span class="c1"># a good idea to leave the defaults untouched.</span>
